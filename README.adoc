= Deprecated

I now build a hugo container via my https://github.com/csmith/dockerfiles[dockerfiles]
repository. It is kept up-to-date automatically (unlike this repo). You can pull it
from `reg.c5h.io/hugo`.

== Hugo docker image

This is a base image I use for building static websites using https://gohugo.io[Hugo].

It contains a recent version of hugo-extended, https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor],
and http://pygments.org/[Pygments] support for them both.

Typical use will look like:

[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM csmith/hugo AS hugo

ADD site /tmp/site
RUN hugo -b https://example.com -v -s /tmp/site -d /tmp/output

# Further process or serve the generated output
FROM another/image 

COPY --from=hugo /tmp/output ....
----
